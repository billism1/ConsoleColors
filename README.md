<h1>Console Colors</h1>

<p>Console Colors is a simple Visual Studio 2010/2012 C# .Net (4.0) project that demonstrates cursor positioning, background/foreground colors, simple threading with mutex locking (to synchronize multiple threads writing to the console at once), and random number generation.</p>

<p>This console app will produce what may be described as psychedelic + epilective spouts of random dancing colorful patterns.</p>

<p>I know this isn't particularly useful, except for perhaps some basic examples. My main purpose of this project is to check out GitHub.</p>
